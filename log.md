# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 14, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Started working on my personal website (desktop version)

**Thoughts:** I struggle with good content to put on the page. And still need to check CSS code from other projects if something does not work out. Is this normal? I don't know. I'll keep at it though. Practice, practice, PRACTICE!
